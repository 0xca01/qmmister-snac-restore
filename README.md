# qmmister-snac-restore
Simple PCB to assist with restoring SNAC pins to their expected location on the QMTech MiSTer board. Tested wth a MiSTer Multisystem but may be suitable for other applications too. Can be mounted front or rear side, taking into consideration the position of the pin 1 designator.
